### Abstract
> Semantic correspondence methods have advanced to obtaining high-quality correspondences employing complicated networks, aiming to maximize the model capacity. However, despite the performance improvements, they may remain constrained by the scarcity of training keypoint pairs, a consequence of the limited training images and the sparsity of keypoints. This paper builds on the hypothesis that there is an inherent data-hungry matter in learning semantic correspondences and uncovers the models can be more trained by employing densified training pairs. We demonstrate a simple machine annotator reliably enriches paired key points via machine supervision, requiring neither extra labeled key points nor trainable modules from unlabeled images. Consequently, our models surpass current state-of-the-art models on semantic correspondence learning benchmarks like SPair-71k, PF-PASCAL, and PF-WILLOW and enjoy further robustness on corruption benchmarks.


### Our Motivation: 
Current semantic correspondence learning suffers from **data hunger** during training:
- (a) Labeled images in SPair-71k contain sparse manually annotated keypoint pairs 
- (b) Unlabeled images could be hidden supplementary sources to increase the pairs' density.
- (c) Newly expanded image pairs can provide abundant densified pairs to alleviate the data-hungry matter.
